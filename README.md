# Social Learner Website

## Social Media Learning
Nowadays, everyone is using social media to communicate with others, get information and entertain themselves. Although the social media has grown dramatically across all ages, there are many of older adults still not familiar with social media. I would like to design a website to teach people, especially the older adults to use the social media. In the website, there are some information will be shown like the introduction of social media interface, show the steps of how to use the social media, and some tips of using social media safety. The website should be easy to browse by user and make sure they would not be confused when navigate the website.
